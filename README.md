# Robotic Arm Project 

## Introduction
This project utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently recognize text and voice inputs for color selection. Users can input colors via text or voice commands, and the system will process the input to determine the selected color.


## Features 
- **Intelligent Recognition:** Text and speech processing using LLMs
- **Color Selection:** AI-driven color determination
- **Speech Command Support:** Voice-based interaction
- **Remote Storage:** Results uploaded to an Ubuntu server



## Usage
1. Ensure your environment is set up and dependencies are installed.
2. Run `python main.py` to start the recognition system.
3. Use the GUI to input a color via text or voice.
4. The system processes the input and determines the recognized color.
5. Results are saved locally and uploaded to an Ubuntu server.
